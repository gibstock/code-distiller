# Code Distiller Movie Reviews

## Purpose
This project was mainly built to learn CRUD operations. But the concept is something I've always been fascinated with. 

Now the intention is to provide a space where anyone can post a review of anything in the entertainment space. Saw a funny toothpaste commercial? Review it. Liked a Ryan Reynolds youtube video? Review it. 

## Future Features
* Maintain anonymous posting but also implement a signup and user profile for anyone wanting to track their posts.

* Implement a "like" type system.
* Introduce discussion boards.
* Ability to add a review to movies already existing in the system.
* Search by category, user or tag.
* Make tag system.
* Implement photo uploading for generating public urls.

It is up and running but also a work in progress. Please feel free to contribute a review to the site.
